topic: Wall of Integrity
description: Ir. Dr. Nehemiah Lee Chee Hai invented the Nehemiah Walls, the well-known, soil-retaining wall made of hexagonal panels that line our highways. You may see his concrete walls everywhere when traveling down the highways or passing beside flyovers, such as KL-Karak Highway and Second East-West Highway. They had a distinctive feature of interlocking hexagonal panels and a technology to make a wall to last for 120 years! Getting the idea while working with Reinforced Earth in the 80s, Dr. Lee studied the concept and researched diligently to modify the system in tandem with working on his Mastersâ€™ degree. <br><br> When he first ventured into business, Dr.Lee didn't even know how to read a financial statement. In addition, due to the company's novelty, it became a subject of mockery. "Nehemiah wall? Never heard of it. It will sure collapse one lah" was the usual comment he received. He also faced challenges to hire employees. Instead of interviewing employees, they interviewed him back for company's history in the market and growth because they were concerned that the company wasn't stable. His reluctance to conform to bribery made him lost many projects as he is strongly firm on his moral compass. <br><br> However, today, Dr. Nehemiah sits as the Founder of Nehemiah Soils Sdn. Bhd., which, in addition to Nehemiah Reinforced Walls, also works on other related construction projects such as slope stabilization using a geotextile reinforced soil system called GreenMur and the promotion of Segmented Wall, a geogrid reinforced wall with decorative finish, ideal for landscaping. The company has become the recipient of numerous awards such as the Brand Laureate, Red Bull, Ernst & Young and Star Outstanding Business Award from its inception in 1993. <br><br> Dr. Lee believes in the value of honesty and incorruptibility in business and has never resorted to bribery to get ahead in the business world with his company. In recognition of his practice of integrity in business, the Institution of Civil Engineers, United Kingdom conferred the International Award to him in 2013. <br><br> Now, the Nehemiah Group of Companies includes Nehemiah Reinforced Soil Sdn Bhd, Nehemiah Geosynthetics Sdn Bhd, Nehemiah Prestress Sdn Bhd, Nehemiah Towoong Bridgetech Sdn Bhd, and Cribwall (M) Sdn Bhd. includes Nehemiah Reinforced Soil Sdn Bhd, Each of these companies focuses on a specialized sector of the construction.
