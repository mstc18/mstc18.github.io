                <p>Antecedents instalments of Malaysian Students Technology Conference (MSTC) have been breakthrough
                by their own rights; the <a style="color: #04a5aa;" href="https://msiastc.github.io/2016/index">first</a> being the pioneer and the <a style="color: #04a5aa;" href="https://msiastc.github.io">second</a> being the innovator. MSTC has and always will be a platform to congregate motivated students who are passionate about current and future technology and its impact on society. In the third instalment this year,
                we are shaping the conference to be interactive and impactful; coherent to our desire to be one of the most
                transformative and distruptive events happening in our world nowadays. As the Fourth Industrial Revolution is 
                changing the world we know today, breakthroughs are being forged right in the very heart of the revolution. We are
                hoping to demonstrate the breakthroughs in technology that mankind has achieved thus far through the discovery of something by exploration and its significance. With shared experience from experts in numerous fields such as big
                data analytics, cybersecurity as well as many more up and coming fields, we are confident that MSTC is the platform to achieve this aspiration.

                            <h3>Topic: Keynote</h3>
                            <p>Datuk Iain Lo has been in the oil and gas industry for nearly 30 years. He obtained Bachelor of Science in Civil Engineering in 1987 and Master of Science in Civil Engineering in 1988 from University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). He first delved into this industry after he realised his job as a consulting civil engineer did not cater towards his ambition of leaving a mark in society. Since joining Shell, he had been all over the world, enhancing and acquiring skills professionally and personally. He currently serves as the Shell Malaysia chairman and also managing director of Sarawak Shell Bhd and Sabah Shell Petroleum Co Ltd. Under his watch, Shell continues to be one of the best examples for companies to emphasise on giving back to the community. One of the most prominent contributions would be setting up a Piasau Nature Reserve in Miri. Moreover, he believes that his role as the chairman of a prominent company is also to develop Malaysia’s talent pool, especially among the younger generation. He aspires to build future leaders who can guide the country with heart and passion. Thus, Datuk Iain Lo continues to empower and inspire the youth to step out their boundaries and make the differences we want to see.</p>

                            <p>Mohammad Izzal Amaani is an Associate Producer Company at Streamline Games. He began his career in Training and Development in the insurance industry. His passion for working and building people got him noticed at Streamline where he was brought in to manage the company’s many projects. As the Associate Producer Company, Izzal manages multiple projects as the product owner. Known for sporting a Unicorn Hoodie in the office, he can be seen blowing things up in the production process to get the gears moving in production. He is a Malaysian born raised in the UK, Izzal grew up in a modest family of 5. On the rare occasions where he's not blowing stuff up, he can be seen lugging his team members around the city hunting for the best food in town. Having 2 AAA titles under his belt, as well as multiple unannounced projects, it's unlikely that Izzal will run out of things to blow up anytime soon.</p>
