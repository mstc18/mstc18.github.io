description: As a first year Economics student in UCL, Zhi Chao joined the team because he believes that everyone, regardless of their profession, can and should take part in understanding, realising and developing new technology. He aims to provide a different perspective for the team especially from the economics side so that the conference can be further diversified. His knowledge in the finance and economics field is reflected in his achievement in Hult Prize at UCL and EY Business Challenge 2018. Additionally, he aspires to enhance the interactiveness and the inclusivity of the conference by injecting new elements that are previously untouched and unheard of.
