description: Daniel joined as Group CEO of Sedania Innovator Bhd in January 2018. He holds a Master degree in International Business Administration from the European Business School, Oestrich-Winkel, Germany, and a BSc in Computer Science from James Madison University, Virginia, U.S. He started his career in Investment Banking with Broadview International / Jeffrey’s Investment Bank, London, where he was advising on Mergers & Acquisitions in technology industries, in particular software and internet-based businesses. Daniel continued his career as Investment Banking Associate for WestLB Panmure, London, UK, in M&A advisory for High-Tech Engineering. Since 2004, he established a proven track record in founding and expanding multiple tech-centric businesses, including his role as CEO of ARIF Solutions, a software company for purpose-built technological solutions for notable clients in Malaysia, including the FEI World Endurance Championships 2008 equestrian event organised by former Agong Sultan Mizan Zainal Abidin, and the Standard Chartered KL Marathon. In 2006, he founded and expanded the Presto Group in Malaysia which operated 4 supermarkets in Klang Valley and became the first online supermarket in Malaysia with annual turnover of RM30 million, before he exited in 2015. Daniel’s ability to forsee marketable business models from emerging technologies, combined with his passion to articulate and execute such strategies, makes him a valuable catalyst to Sedania’s vision.
