description: Datuk Iain Lo has been in the oil and gas industry for nearly 30 years. He obtained Bachelor of Science in Civil Engineering in 1987 and Master of Science in Civil Engineering in 1988 from University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). He first delved into this industry after he realised his job as a consulting civil engineer did not cater towards his ambition of leaving a mark in society. Since joining Shell, he had been all over the world, enhancing and acquiring skills professionally and personally. He currently serves as the Shell Malaysia chairman and also managing director of Sarawak Shell Bhd and Sabah Shell Petroleum Co Ltd. Under his watch, Shell continues to be one of the best examples for companies to emphasise on giving back to the community. One of the most prominent contributions would be setting up a Piasau Nature Reserve in Miri. Moreover, he believes that his role as the chairman of a prominent company is also to develop Malaysiaâ€™s talent pool, especially among the younger generation. He aspires to build future leaders who can guide the country with heart and passion. Thus, Datuk Iain Lo continues to empower and inspire the youth to step out their boundaries and make the differences we want to see.
