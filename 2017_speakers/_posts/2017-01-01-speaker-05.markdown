description: Mohammad Izzal Amaani is an Associate Producer Company at Streamline Games. He began his career in Training and Development in the insurance industry. His passion for working and building people got him noticed at Streamline where he was brought in to manage the companyâ€™s many projects. As the Associate Producer Company, Izzal manages multiple projects as the product owner. Known for sporting a Unicorn Hoodie in the office, he can be seen blowing things up in the production process to get the gears moving in production. He is a Malaysian born raised in the UK, Izzal grew up in a modest family of 5. On the rare occasions where he's not blowing stuff up, he can be seen lugging his team members around the city hunting for the best food in town. Having 2 AAA titles under his belt, as well as multiple unannounced projects, it's unlikely that Izzal will run out of things to blow up anytime soon.
