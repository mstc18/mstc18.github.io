                <p>Antecedents instalments of Malaysian Students Technology Conference (MSTC) have been breakthrough
                by their own rights; the <a style="color: #04a5aa;" href="https://msiastc.github.io/2016/index">first</a> being the pioneer and the <a style="color: #04a5aa;" href="https://msiastc.github.io">second</a> being the innovator. MSTC has and always will be a platform to congregate motivated students who are passionate about current and future technology and its impact on society. In the third instalment this year,
                we are shaping the conference to be interactive and impactful; coherent to our desire to be one of the most
                transformative and distruptive events happening in our world nowadays. As the Fourth Industrial Revolution is 
                changing the world we know today, breakthroughs are being forged right in the very heart of the revolution. We are
                hoping to demonstrate the breakthroughs in technology that mankind has achieved thus far through the discovery of something by exploration and its significance. With shared experience from experts in numerous fields such as big
                data analytics, cybersecurity as well as many more up and coming fields, we are confident that MSTC is the platform to achieve this aspiration.
