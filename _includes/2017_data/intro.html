                <p>Building upon the successes of <a href="/2016">last year's</a> pioneering 
                    <a href="/about#MSTC">Malaysian Students Technology Conference</a>
                    or <a href="/about#MSTC">MSTC</a> for short, this year we are hoping to direct it 
                    towards one of the most transformative 
                    and disruptive events happening in our world today. The fourth industrial revolution as it has 
                    come to be known as is dramatically changing the way the world works but so few people are aware 
                    of it and much less able to stay ahead of the curve and remain competitive in a diverse and ever 
                    changing environment. With this conference, we hope to bring Malaysian students which represent 
                    the future of our country together with experts in the relevant fields such as big data analytics,
                    cyber-physical systems and many more up and coming fields which we feel the future leaders of our 
                    country should have a strong grasp of.
