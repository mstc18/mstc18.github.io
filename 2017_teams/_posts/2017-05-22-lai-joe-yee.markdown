description: Nadhihah is a chemical process engineering graduate from Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur. She is currently the Vice President of Student Platform For Engineering Education Development (SPEED), which is a non-profit organisation that intends to web engineering students around the world. She believes that the best way to find a solution towards trending problems is to eat, live and breathe with the affected local community. Therefore, she has been actively participating in several local and international projects as well as volunteering programs in South Korea, Indonesia, Russia, Turkey and more. She hopes MSTC will be a notable success recognised by not just Malaysians in the country and abroad, but also in the international community in terms of its sustainability and impact towards the participants.
