description: Ka Shing believes that technology is something everyone sees and hears, but few understands. The game-changing innovations that recently hit the market wowed many with their convenience, but not many know about how these technologies came to be. With this in mind, he is keen on bringing MSTC to students looking to test the waters with the technology sector. He hopes to build MSTC 2018 upon the successes of its predecessors and continue to connect students to the industry. This second year Electronics and Electrical Engineering student at UCL codes odd programs during his free time!
