He joined MSTC with the strong belief that it will be a great platform to learn and to share as well as to work with a team of talented people across different time zones. He is passionate in issues on education and ways of building the environment. With his skills and experiences in various events such as the University of Bath’s Architecture and Civil Engineering Society and Taylor’s College Classroom Xperience (CXP), he hopes to redefine what a student conference can be and brings impact by inspiring others with new perspectives and ideas.
