description: For the preliminaries, Miaoling absolutely loves conferences. She has handled multiple conferences including TEDx University of Leeds where she was exposed to primarily Legal Technology. Inspired, she would like to understand how technology can impact different industries, and how should we arm ourselves with skills to stay ahead of the trend. She is a firm believer of team culture. She thinks what makes a great team is the relationship that membersâ€™ share, and the willingness to go an extra mile to increase team efficiency. She is keen to take up responsibilities as that allows her to understand her strengths and weaknesses, as well as learning how to better communicate and compromise.
