description: Brandon is a third year Chemical Engineering student in Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman. As the Director of Editorial Department in YME Malaysia, he joined the MSTC team with the hopes of working with talented Malaysian students from all over the globe. His aspiration for MSTC 2018 is to create a platform for STEM enthusiasts regardless of their background to interact with minimal formality. This motivation stems from his observation that technology or at least educational gatherings are often in a sense "unapproachable" for the general public due to its prestigious branding. Besides being a fan of photography, he is also a fan of Anton Bruckner's symphonies!
