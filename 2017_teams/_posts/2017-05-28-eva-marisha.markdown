description: As a final year student who is completing her law degree in Kingâ€™s College London, Zhi Ling believes that more focus should be put into understanding technology and its utilization to develop other non-scientifically related industries. Her involvement in various organisations has given her various insights which helps her lead the research and strategy department. She hopes to make MSTC an interactive and impactful conference. Fun fact - she favours outdoor sports such as parasailing and jet-skiing!
